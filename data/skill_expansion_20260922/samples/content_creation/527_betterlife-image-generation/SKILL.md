# BetterLife Daily Social Image Generation (kie.ai image-to-image)

Generate the daily BetterLife social media image using **kie.ai's grok-imagine/image-to-image**
model, conditioned on Mira reference photos from Google Drive. This is **image-to-image**,
not text-to-image — the model generates from reference images, not from a prompt alone.

## Architecture
```
Compose Prompt (scene + attire + mood + angle)
  → Select 8 Mira reference images (5 for grok) from 20 GDrive photos
    → Send to kie.ai grok-imagine/image-to-image (strength 0.85)
      → Fallback: flux-2/flex-image-to-image on failure
        → Save to ~/workspace/tool-image-generation/
```

## Credentials
- **KIE_API_KEY** — for the kie.ai API
- Read from credential source by label — never hardcode.

## Reference images (Supabase S3 storage)

Reference images are stored in Supabase storage at:
`https://dbbppsbtpsahdkmevxgm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/instagram_images/`

File naming: `{character}_reference_{nn}_{pose}.jpg`

### Reference selection
- **Face anchors (MANDATORY):** front + 3/4 angle references. Always in the first 2 slots.
- **Pose refs (3-6 remaining):** scored by tag overlap with scene keywords, randomly sampled
  from top 14. Grok caps at 5 total refs, flux at 8.

## Character anchor
```
Mira, a wellness coach with natural beauty, shoulder-length dark hair,
warm olive skin, kind eyes, minimal makeup
```

## Prompt composition
Format: `{anchor}, {scene}. {attire}. {detail}. {mood} {accent}. Premium editorial wellness photography, {angle}, no text, no watermarks.`

Components picked combinatorially to avoid repeats: 36 scenes, 8 attires, 10 details, 6 moods, 8 angles, 4 accents.

## kie.ai API call
```json
POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask
{
  "model": "grok-imagine/image-to-image",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "<composed prompt>",
    "image_urls": ["<5 ref URLs>"],
    "strength": 0.85,
    "aspect_ratio": "1:1", "resolution": "1K", "output_format": "jpg"
  }
}
```
Poll GET /api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId={id} every 2s until state=="success".

**Fallback:** flux-2/flex-image-to-image (uses `input_urls`, allows 8 refs).

## Key parameters
- **strength 0.85** — higher = more Mira-likeness, lower = more prompt-driven scene
- **Known limitation:** at strength 0.85 with the same 20 refs, output is structurally dominated
  by the refs. Scene words shift background but not composition. For genuine variety, lower
  strength or add shot-size/framing contrast per variant.

## Post-generation
1. Image saved to `~/workspace/tool-image-generation/betterlife-{theme}-{date}-v{n}.jpg`
2. Review JSON at `/tmp/bl-social-review.json`
3. Posted via `bl_social_post.py` on approval
