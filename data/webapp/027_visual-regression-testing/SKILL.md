# Visual Regression Testing

## Objective

Use this skill to detect meaningful visual regressions and capture stable diagnostic evidence. Keep the scenario deterministic, safe to rerun, and independent of mutable public data.

## Operating Principles

- Use native Python Playwright APIs.
- Run bundled helper scripts with `--help` before relying on them.
- Register routes, listeners, and expectations before the triggering action.
- Prefer semantic locators and observable waits over arbitrary sleeps.
- Launch Chromium in headless mode unless another engine is explicitly required.
- Never expose secrets, submit real payments, or modify uncontrolled production data.
- Always close pages, contexts, and browsers.

## Decision Guide

```text
Is the target state already available?
├─ Yes → Navigate directly and verify it.
└─ No  → Create or mock the smallest safe fixture.

Does the action cross a boundary?
├─ UI only → Assert component state.
├─ Network → Observe the narrow endpoint.
└─ New page/file → Use expect_popup or expect_download.
```

## Execution Steps

1. Identify the smallest safe fixture.
2. Register relevant browser listeners.
3. Set a fixed viewport, reduce motion, normalize dynamic content, and capture a page or component screenshot.
4. Assert the outcome through user-facing semantics.
5. Preserve evidence only when it improves diagnosis.

## Native Playwright Pattern

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, expect

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page(viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 800})
    page.emulate_media(reduced_motion="reduce")
    page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
    page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")
    expect(page).to_have_screenshot("visual-regression-testing.png", animations="disabled")
    browser.close()
```


## Common Pitfall

Animations, timestamps, and random content create noisy screenshot differences.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] The setup can run repeatedly without manual repair.
- [ ] The locator strategy reflects what a user can perceive.
- [ ] The assertion checks the real outcome of the scenario.
- [ ] Dynamic behavior is synchronized through an event or stable state.
- [ ] Failure artifacts are specific enough to diagnose the issue.
- [ ] No credential, production record, or external side effect is exposed.
