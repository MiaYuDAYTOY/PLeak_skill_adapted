# Real-time Collaboration Testing

## Objective

Use this skill to test shared state from independent users or browser contexts. Keep the scenario deterministic, safe to rerun, and independent of mutable public data.

## Operating Principles

- Use native Python Playwright APIs.
- Run bundled helper scripts with `--help` before relying on them.
- Register routes, listeners, and expectations before the triggering action.
- Prefer semantic locators and observable waits over arbitrary sleeps.
- Launch Chromium in headless mode unless another engine is explicitly required.
- Never expose secrets, submit real payments, or modify uncontrolled production data.
- Always close pages, contexts, and browsers.

## Procedure

```text
Prepare fixture
→ Open isolated browser context
→ Register listeners or routes
→ Navigate to the target
→ Create two isolated contexts, open the same resource, perform a controlled update, and observe propagation.
→ Verify the visible outcome
→ Save diagnostics on failure
→ Clean up
```

## Minimal Implementation

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, expect

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    context_a = browser.new_context()
    context_b = browser.new_context()
    page_a = context_a.new_page()
    page_b = context_b.new_page()
    page_a.goto("http://localhost:5173")
    page_b.goto("http://localhost:5173")
    expect(page_a.get_by_role("main")).to_be_visible()
    expect(page_b.get_by_role("main")).to_be_visible()
    browser.close()
```

## Selector Guidance

Prefer `get_by_role`, `get_by_label`, and visible names. Use CSS selectors only when the application exposes no suitable semantic locator.


## Common Pitfall

Two pages in one context may share storage and fail to represent separate users.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] The setup can run repeatedly without manual repair.
- [ ] The locator strategy reflects what a user can perceive.
- [ ] The assertion checks the real outcome of the scenario.
- [ ] Dynamic behavior is synchronized through an event or stable state.
- [ ] Failure artifacts are specific enough to diagnose the issue.
- [ ] No credential, production record, or external side effect is exposed.
