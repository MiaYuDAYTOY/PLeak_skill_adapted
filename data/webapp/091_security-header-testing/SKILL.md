# Security Header Testing

## Objective

Use this skill to validate safe browser-visible security behavior using controlled, non-destructive fixtures. Keep the scenario deterministic, safe to rerun, and independent of mutable public data.

## Operating Principles

- Use native Python Playwright APIs.
- Run bundled helper scripts with `--help` before relying on them.
- Register routes, listeners, and expectations before the triggering action.
- Prefer semantic locators and observable waits over arbitrary sleeps.
- Launch Chromium in headless mode unless another engine is explicitly required.
- Never expose secrets, submit real payments, or modify uncontrolled production data.
- Always close pages, contexts, and browsers.

## Decision Guide

```text
Is the target state already available?
├─ Yes → Navigate directly and verify it.
└─ No  → Create or mock the smallest safe fixture.

Does the action cross a boundary?
├─ UI only → Assert component state.
├─ Network → Observe the narrow endpoint.
└─ New page/file → Use expect_popup or expect_download.
```

## Execution Steps

1. Identify the smallest safe fixture.
2. Register relevant browser listeners.
3. Inspect the relevant response or UI boundary, use harmless markers, and avoid production accounts or harmful payloads.
4. Assert the outcome through user-facing semantics.
5. Preserve evidence only when it improves diagnosis.

## Native Playwright Pattern

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, expect

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    response = page.goto("http://localhost:5173")
    assert response is not None
    assert "content-type" in response.headers
    expect(page.get_by_role("main")).to_be_visible()
    browser.close()
```


## Common Pitfall

Disabling the protection in the test environment defeats the purpose of the check.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] The setup can run repeatedly without manual repair.
- [ ] The locator strategy reflects what a user can perceive.
- [ ] The assertion checks the real outcome of the scenario.
- [ ] Dynamic behavior is synchronized through an event or stable state.
- [ ] Failure artifacts are specific enough to diagnose the issue.
- [ ] No credential, production record, or external side effect is exposed.
